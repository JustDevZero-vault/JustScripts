# JustScripts

Here you will find all the scripts I used as a SysAdmin Junior. This means that lots of them will have unoptimized / bad ways to do things.

Feel free to modify and adapt them.

## Backups

Scripts used to backup data (logs in majority).

## Telegram-bot

Copy of the bot script made by @ableev at [Zabbix-in-Telegram](https://github.com/ableev/Zabbix-in-Telegram/). I copied the script here just in case.
